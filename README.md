## Google API playground
[https://zahego.github.io/Google-Api-Playground/](https://zahego.github.io/Google-Api-Playground/)  
A google map app that you can look at the funny marker with simple HTML and API call. Made by following a tutorial by Traversy Media.

## Motivation
I am really interested in using Google map API for a future project so I created this one as a playground testing tools to see what dumb stuff I can do with it.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guild you through the inital setting up process and 
highlight what the apps can do for you to explore on your own.  


## Notable feature

Enter your API key at:
```

```
explore the functionalities

## Challenges and resolutions
- Setting up the google console developer account was pure pain. Things is even worse when I have to set up billing action before actually using it. I'm not even sure if I would be charged per requests or any other way. At least I got 300 credit free.

## Future enhancement (coming soon)
- Add more interesting markers
- Perhaps something like favorite restaurant map marker
- Use other Google API along this to make a better show case
